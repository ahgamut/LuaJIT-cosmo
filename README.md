# LuaJIT compiled via Cosmopolitan Libc

This repo modifies [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/download.html)-2.1.0-beta3 (source code obtained from [here](https://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.1.0-beta3.tar.gz)) to compile with [Cosmopolitan Libc](https:github.com/jart/cosmopolitan).

This is experimental software, I have not tested it fully.
For a tested version of Lua, refer to the Cosmopolitan Libc repository.

The `libcosmo` folder should contain the Cosmopolitan amalgamation files.
